Testing:
-------

    PhaseOne:
        For testing for the FSTReeTraversal we employed the treeTraversal
        executable. We created intricate directories where in edge-cases 
        could be tested.
        For example: one directory had files under the main directory,
                     and the main directory had subdirectories and other files
                    under it. In testing for this case, we found that our
                    original program would stop after printing a file in
                    the main directory, even though there would be other
                    subdirectories.
        
        For testing for the stringProcessing portion of the project, we 
        utilised the unit_testing framework to create functions to test for
        when there were non-alpha-numeric characters in the different points
        of the string.
        For example: We tested if the non-alpha-numeric char would be removed
                     from the front, the back, and both. As well as, if there
                     was non-alpha-numeric in the middle, it would keep it
                     there as described in the spec.

Hours:
-------
    According to my computers screen time:
        On the first portion of this project we spent 6 hours on this project.
