Time+comments
    
    1. I spent 12 hours or so on week 1. I don't honestly know though, 
    time kinda blurred by on this one. I spent too much time in the 
    Cummings Center. 
    
    2. I would say maybe 14 hours on this one. Same as the first week.
    
    3. The project was cool. I enjoyed the jokes it printed, provided much
    needed laughter.
