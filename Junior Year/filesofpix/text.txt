MAIN
1. Given a file name, open the file

LOOP until eof{
READALINE -> size_t readaline(FILE fd, **datapp)
2. Use readaline to get contents of a line + size of that line in the file
- Create a char *line_being_read and save the pointer as char* start = line_being_read;
- append the contents of a line into line_being_read and expand the size with realloc
- loop: use getc to read char by char (make sure not eof) - read up to '\n', increment size_of_line for each char
- set *datapp to start pointer of line_being_read or to NULL if eof or size_of_line == 0
    2a. char *line = *datapp --> line
    2b. size_t size_of_line = readaline(FILE fd, **datapp) --> size_of_line 

PROCESS LINE into filters
3. Given line, and size_of_line, read through each char in line and filter to infusion_seq vs rawdigits
