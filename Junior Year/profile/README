# Most Time-Consuming Routine in Final UM
Calls to calloc, specifically in calloc'ing each new memory
segment that is mapped. The assembly could not necessarily be
improved, as it appears to be pretty optimized. There aren't
really unneccessary function calls/computations, just a 
lot of library calls that seem necessary to performing
the calloc operation.
